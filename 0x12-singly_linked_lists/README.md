Linked Lists Vs Arrays
Arrays come in handy in small controllable problems, where we have a certain kind of information on the data. Easily manipulated and very fast.
Linked lists on the other hand are useful in uncertain events, where info may vary from time to time, harder to manipulate compared to arrays but get the job done.
