### Hash Tables
* Hash Tables are data structures that maps keys to values via a hash function.

* Personally, I see Hash Tables as an array of linked lists with data connected
  via a hash function.

* A **good hash function** is one which generates minimal collisions.

* A collision is a situation where more than one value assigned to a hash.
  This increases complexity of the data structure and raises issues.

* The advantage of Hash tables is that it gives us the organization of arrays
  while we enjoy the uncertainty advantage of linked lists.
