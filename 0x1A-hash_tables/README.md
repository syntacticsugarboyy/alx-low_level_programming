A hash function is a function that maps data of arbitrary size to fixed size values.
It's a fucntion that maps data to hash tables...

A good hash function is a function that has minimal collisions.

A hash table is a data structure that stores implemented dictionaries(data mapped to keys)

Collisions are situations where two or more dictionaries(data) share the same hash

Hash tables are advantageous as they are very fast. They have a time complexity of constant time O(1).
