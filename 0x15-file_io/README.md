File descriptors come in three forms stdin, stdout and stderr.
open opens a file or program
close closes a file or program
read reads a file or program
write writes a file or program

A system call is a way for programs to interact with the operating system. They are the only entry points into the kernel.
All system calls are functions but not all functions are system calls.
